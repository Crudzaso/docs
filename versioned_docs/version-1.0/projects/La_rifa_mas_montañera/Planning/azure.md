### 2. Create a Resource for the Application
1. In the portal, click **"Create a resource"**.

2. Select **App Service** to deploy the web application:

   - **Operating system**: Select **Linux**.
   - **Runtime stack**: Choose the appropriate one, such as PHP or Node.js, depending on what you use in your backend.
   - **Price plan**: Choose the most basic one during development.

### 3. Configure the Database
1. Search for **Azure Database for MySQL** or **Azure SQL Database** (depending on your preference).
2. Configure:
   - **Server name**: Something like `rifasdb`.
   - **User and password**: Save these credentials to connect them in your application.

## Scalability and Maintenance

### Scalability
- Enable **auto-scaling** if you expect a large number of users participating in raffles. This is configured in the **App Service Plan**.

### Security
- Implements secure authentication (Oath2) and encrypts sensitive data, such as passwords.
- Make sure database connections are secure by enabling SSL.

### Monitoring
- Use **Application Insights** to monitor platform performance and errors.
