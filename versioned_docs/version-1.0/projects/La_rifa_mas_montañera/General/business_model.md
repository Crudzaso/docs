# Business Model 

**The most mountainous raffle** aims to offer an attractive and transparent experience for users, providing the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes through the purchase of tickets. Below is the complete business model logic, cost and profit calculations, and an example of how the net value of 100 tickets sold is calculated.


### **Overview**

This project follows a **B2C** (Business to Consumer) business model, where users buy tickets to participate in raffles. Each ticket represents an opportunity to win prizes while enjoying a clear and fair experience. Revenues generated from ticket sales are shared between the platform and the sweepstakes organizers.


### **Revenue Structure**.

1. **Ticket Sales**: The platform earns a percentage of each ticket sale, and this percentage is used to cover operating costs and generate revenue.
2. **Advertising**: Advertisements within the platform will generate additional revenue.

### **Cost Structure**.

1. **Payment Gateway Commission**: The platform uses a payment gateway that charges a percentage per transaction. This cost is deducted from the value of each ticket.
2. **Cloud Infrastructure**: The use of cloud services, such as Azure, will have an associated monthly cost.
3. **Platform Maintenance**: Includes costs related to support, upgrades, and other operational activities.


### Platform Profit** 

The platform maintains a profit percentage of **0.5%** on the price of each ticket sold. This percentage is used to cover operating costs and generate revenue for the business.


### **Calculation of the Net Ticket Value**.

The business logic also includes a detailed calculation of the net value of each ticket sold, after deducting the payment gateway commission and the platform's profit. Below are the calculations for different types of ballots.
