## Good practices on github

### Workflow

1. **Creating a new branch** for every new feature:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/(featureCodeInDevOps)/new_functionality

Making changes and commits frecuently.
Doing pull requests (PR) to the main respository when the functionality is ready for reviews.
Use of Issues
Once a problem is detected or a new functionality is needed, assign a new issue on GitHub.
