##  General Description
The project consists of the development of a web platform that allows the sale of tickets to participate in raffles organized by users. The raffles will be linked to the drawings of the Medellin Lottery, and each ticket purchased corresponds to a random number that gives the user the opportunity to win.

### Types of users on the platform:
- **Administrator** ğŸ‘‘: Manages the platform, users, and raffles.
- **Organizer** ğŸŒŸ: Creates raffles, buys ballots, and manages their raffles.
- **Customer** ğŸ‘¤: Buys tickets for active raffles and participates in them.
- **Guests** ğŸ‘¥: Explore the platform but must register to participate.
