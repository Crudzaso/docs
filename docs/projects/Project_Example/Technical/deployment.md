# Project Deployment Guide

## Production Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the project to a production environment:

1. **Prepare the production environment**: Ensure that all required dependencies are installed and configured on the production server.
2. **Build the Docker image**: Build a Docker image of the project to ensure consistency across environments.
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-project .
    ```
3. **Run the Docker container**: Once the image is built, run the project in a Docker container.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 80:80 my-project
    ```
4. **Configure Nginx (Optional)**: If you're using Nginx as a reverse proxy, configure it to serve the project on the appropriate port and with an SSL certificate.
    - Set up SSL using Let's Encrypt or a similar certificate authority to secure the traffic.
    - Point Nginx to the Docker container’s internal port (usually `80`).
5. **Verify the deployment**: After the container is running, access the production URL to ensure everything is working as expected.

## Docker Deployment

Docker simplifies the deployment process by containerizing the application, ensuring consistency between different environments.

1. **Build the Docker image**: 
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-project .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
    To run the application in the container, map the container’s port to the host machine’s port:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 80:80 my-project
    ```

3. **Monitor the container logs**: 
    If you encounter any issues, check the logs of the running container to debug:
    ```bash
    docker logs <container-id>
    ```

By using Docker, we ensure that the application behaves the same across local, staging, and production environments, making deployment seamless and reliable.
