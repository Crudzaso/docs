# Board Management

## Kanban Board
We use the Azure DevOps Kanban board to visualize the progress of tasks through different stages. The Kanban board consists of the following columns:
- **To Do**: Tasks that are ready to be worked on.
- **In Progress**: Tasks that are currently being worked on by team members.
- **Done**: Tasks that have been completed and are ready for review.

## Sprints and Milestones
We organize our work into 2-week Sprints, with each Sprint targeting a specific set of features or bug fixes. Milestones are used to group related Sprints and track progress towards larger project goals.

## Metrics and Reports
The Azure DevOps Boards provide various metrics and reports to help us monitor the team's productivity and the project's progress. Some of the key metrics we track include:
- **Velocity**: The average number of work items completed per Sprint.
- **Burndown Chart**: Visualizes the remaining work over time, helping us identify potential issues.
- **Cumulative Flow Diagram**: Shows the flow of work items through the different stages, highlighting bottlenecks.
