# Task Management

In this project, Azure DevOps is used to manage tasks and track progress. Here's how we organize our work using Azure DevOps:

1. **Create Work Items**: Each task, bug, or feature is logged as a work item. These work items are categorized by type (e.g., Task, Bug, Feature) and tagged with relevant information.
2. **Assign Tasks**: Each task is assigned to a developer who is responsible for its completion. Team members can view tasks in the Azure DevOps Kanban board, allowing for easy task tracking and updates.
3. **Track Progress**: We use Azure DevOps Boards to visualize the progress of tasks through different stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
4. **Prioritize Tasks**: Tasks are assigned priority labels (High, Medium, Low) to ensure that the most important features are addressed first.
5. **Milestones and Sprints**: The tasks are organized into sprints and milestones to keep the project on track and meet deadlines.
