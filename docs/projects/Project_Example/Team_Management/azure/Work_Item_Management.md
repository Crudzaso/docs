# Work Item Management

## Work Item Types
In our project, we use the following work item types in Azure DevOps:
- **Task**: Represents a specific piece of work that needs to be completed.
- **Bug**: Tracks software defects that need to be fixed.
- **Feature**: Describes a new functionality that needs to be implemented.

## Work Item Attributes
Each work item in Azure DevOps has the following attributes:
- **Title**: A brief description of the work item.
- **Description**: Detailed information about the task, bug, or feature.
- **Assigned To**: The team member responsible for completing the work item.
- **Priority**: The importance of the work item (High, Medium, Low).
- **Tags**: Custom labels used to categorize and filter work items.

## Assigning Work Items
Work items are assigned to team members based on their skills, availability, and the project's priorities. The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that work is distributed evenly and that team members are not overloaded.
