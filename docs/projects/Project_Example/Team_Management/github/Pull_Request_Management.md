# Pull Request Management

## Reviewers
- All pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member before merging.
- The Scrum Master or designated reviewers are responsible for reviewing and approving pull requests.

## Merging
- Once a pull request has been reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the main branch.
- Use the **"Squash and Merge"** option to maintain a clean commit history.
