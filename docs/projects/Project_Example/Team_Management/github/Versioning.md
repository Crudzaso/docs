# Versioning

## Semantic Versioning
- We follow the **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** standard for our project.
- The version format is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:
  - **MAJOR**: Incremented for breaking changes.
  - **MINOR**: Incremented for new features.
  - **PATCH**: Incremented for bug fixes.

## Version Tagging
- Create a new tag for each release, following the SemVer format (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
- Tags should be pushed to the remote repository after the main branch has been updated.
