# Business Model

This project uses a freemium model, where users can participate in basic raffles for free, but paid options are available for exclusive raffles or higher chances of winning.

Revenue is generated through:
- Subscription fees for premium access to raffles.
- Transaction fees for payments processed on the platform.
- Sponsored raffles and promotions from partners.
