## Core Features of an Ideal Raffle Solution  

### 1. Secure User Access and Management  
- Every user must access their account through a secure login process, ensuring the protection of personal data and participation history.  
- Organizers and administrators will have differentiated, managed access levels, ensuring that each role has the appropriate permissions for their specific responsibilities.  

### 2. Simplified Ticket Purchase Process  
- Participants should effortlessly browse available raffles, select tickets, and complete their purchases through a streamlined and intuitive process.  
- The system must integrate electronic payment methods compliant with local regulations, providing a smooth and secure user experience.  

### 3. Transparent and Configurable Raffle Creation  
- Organizers must have clear and accessible tools to set up their raffles, define prizes, and establish participation rules.  
- Transparency in raffle creation and management is critical to building user trust and maintaining the platform's reputation.  

### 4. Device Compatibility and Accessibility  
- Each platform must be fully compatible with mobile devices, ensuring an optimized user experience from any location.  
- The design must adhere to accessibility principles to enable individuals with diverse abilities to use the platform without difficulty.  

### 5. Compliance with Legal Regulations  
- As raffles involve financial transactions and prize-based draws, each platform must strictly adhere to local legal requirements.  
- Operational limits must be verified to ensure all activities comply with applicable laws, helping to prevent legal issues and strengthen user confidence.

## Project Structure and Organization  

### 1. Task Management with Azure DevOps  
- Each raffle platform project will be managed by teams of up to three members.  
- Team coordination and task tracking will be conducted via Azure DevOps, providing a clear view of progress, potential blockers, and project goals.  
- Azure DevOps will facilitate feature planning and keep all team members aligned with objectives and deadlines.  

### 2. Repository and Version Control Conventions on GitHub  
- **Branch Structure**:  
  - `main`: For production-ready code.  
  - `develop`: For active development.  
  - `feature/{id_task}/{title_task}`: For specific tasks or features.  
- **Repository Naming**:  
  - Repositories should use `snake_case` for clarity and consistency. Example: `raffle_solution_crudzaso`.  
- **Commit Message Conventions**:  
  - Commit messages must be clear and concise, following the `type(scope): description` format. Example types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`.  

### 3. Team Documentation and Transparency  
- Each repository will include a `README` file detailing:  
  - Key functionalities.  
  - Installation and configuration instructions.  
- Additionally, each platform will feature a landing page with an **About Us** section, including:  
  - Brief team member descriptions.  
  - Photos of team members.  
  - Optionally, a group video to enhance trust by showing the people behind the platform.

## Recommendations for Task Management  

### 1. Epics  
- Represent high-level goals or core functionalities encompassing multiple aspects of the platform.  
- Examples of epics:  
  - "User Authentication."  
  - "Raffle Creation and Management."  
  - "Ticket Purchase Process."  
  - "Payment Integration."  
- Each epic must include a clear description of the user value it provides.  

### 2. Features  
- Subcomponents of each epic, described as **user stories** whenever possible.  
  - Example of a User Story:  
    - "As a user, I want to log in and out securely so that my personal information and account data remain protected."  
- Examples of features under the "User Authentication" epic:  
  - Login and Logout Process.  
  - OAuth Integration.  
  - Password Recovery.  

### 3. Tasks  
- Tasks break down each feature into specific actions that facilitate implementation.  
- Each task must include detailed expectations and acceptance criteria to ensure any team member can understand and complete the task efficiently.

## Best Practices for Documentation  

- **Clear, Detailed Descriptions**: Ensure every epic, feature, and task includes comprehensive explanations of what is expected, why it is needed, and the desired outcome.  
- **User Story Orientation**: Frame epics and features as user stories wherever possible to maintain a focus on user experience.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define measurable standards for each task to ensure deliverables meet expectations.  
- **Consistent Use of English**: All documentation, including epics, features, tasks, and technical details, must be in English to facilitate team collaboration and external communication.
