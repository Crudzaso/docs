Raffle Creators set up their raffles by providing the following details:  
- **Raffle Name**  
- **Ticket Price**  
- **Total Number of Tickets**  
- **Deadline for Ticket Sales**  

### 2. Ticket Sales  
- Participants purchase tickets within the defined period.  
- A raffle is considered valid if at least 60% of the tickets are sold.  

### 3. Raffle Execution  
- **If the 60% sales threshold is met**:  
  - **50%** of the total revenue goes to the raffle winner.  
  - **10%** is taken as a commission by the platform administrators.  
  - **40% or less** (depending on total sales) is awarded to the Raffle Creator as net profit.  
- **If the 60% sales threshold is not met**:  
  - The raffle is deemed unsuccessful.  
  - Refunds are issued to participants, minus potential administrative fees.
