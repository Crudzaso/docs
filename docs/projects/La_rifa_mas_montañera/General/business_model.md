# Business Model 

**The most mountainous sweepstakes** aims to offer an attractive and transparent experience to users by providing the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes through the purchase of tickets. Below is the complete business model logic, cost and profit calculations, and an example of how the net value of 100 tickets sold is calculated.


**Overview** **Overview**

This project follows a **B2C** (Business to Consumer) business model, in which users purchase tickets to participate in sweepstakes. Each ticket represents an opportunity to win prizes while enjoying a clear and fair experience. Revenues generated from ticket sales are shared between the platform and the sweepstakes organizers, with a fair distribution of these revenues in accordance with established policies and laws.


**Revenue structure**.

1. **Ticket sales**: The platform gets a percentage of each ticket sale, and this percentage is used to cover operational costs and generate revenue.

2. **Cloud infrastructure**: 
The use of cloud services, such as Azure, will have an associated monthly cost.
 3. **Platform maintenance**: 
Includes costs related to support, upgrades and other operational activities.


### Platform profit**. 

The platform maintains a profit percentage of **4.4%** on the price of each ticket sold. This percentage is used to cover operating costs and generate revenue for the business.


**Net Ticket Value Calculation**.

The business logic also includes a detailed calculation of the net value of each ticket sold, net of the payment gateway commission and platform profit. Below are the calculations for the different ticket types.


**Calculations of the Net Value per Ticket**.

1. **Net Value per Ticket of 2000**:
   - **Payment gateway commission**: 4.4% of ticket value.
   - Platform Profit**: 0.5% of the ticket value.
   - Net Value per Ticket**: 935$ COP.
    - In the future, this charge will be added to the users, since it is a loss for the company.


### **Explanation of Calculations**:

1. **Payment Gateway Commission**: It is calculated as a percentage (4.4%) of the price of each ticket. This percentage is deducted from the total price of the ticket before calculating the platform's profit.
   
2. **Platform Profit**: The platform retains 0.5% of each ticket sold, as net profit.

3. **Net Value per 100 Ballots**: We multiply the net value per ballot (after deducting the gateway commission and platform profit) by **100**.

## **Conclusion**.

This business model is designed to generate revenue in an efficient and scalable manner, while maintaining a seamless and engaging user experience. The combination of a clear cost structure, a revenue model based on ticket sales and the integration of secure payment tools, allows for maximizing profits while ensuring transparency and fairness in the draws.
